I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Geography](https://geography.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). I received a Ph.D. in Geography, an M.S. in Geography from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), and a B.E. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). Before joining VT Geography, he worked with Prof. [Shaowen Wang](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/shaowen) at the [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital & Spatial Studies](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/) and [Institute for Geospatial Understanding through an Integrative Discovery Environment (I-GUIDE)](https://i-guide.io/).

My research interests are centered around **GIScience**, **Geospatial Data Science** and **Computational Science**, aiming to tackle complex geospatial problems and understand multi-scale urban dynamics using heterogeneous geospatial big data. Specifically, my research work focuses on 1) geospatial data science for understanding multi-scale urban dynamics, where I integrate machine learning with cyberGIS to predict and analyze complex urban phenomena (e.g. Urban Heat Islands) and develop frameworks for extracting information from heterogenous spatiotemporal data (e.g. high-frequency sensor data, social media data); 2) scalable spatial algorithms for solving complex geospatial problems, including developing scalable algorithms and models for geospatial analysis (e.g. remote sensing image fusion) using high-performance computing; and 3) democratization of data-intensive geographic research, where I innovate geospatial middleware approaches to simplify access to advanced cyberinfrastructure and enable collaborative geographic research and education.
