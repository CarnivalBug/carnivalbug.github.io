I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Geography](https://geography.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). I received a Ph.D. in Geography, an M.S. in Geography from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), and a B.E. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I currently serve as Vice Chair for the [Cyberinfrastructure Specialty Group](https://aagcisg.wordpress.com/) at the American Association of Geographers.

My research interests are centered around **GIScience**, **Geospatial Data Science** and **Computational Science**, aiming to tackle complex geospatial problems and understand multi-scale urban dynamics using heterogeneous geospatial big data. Specifically, my research work focuses on 1) geospatial data science for understanding multi-scale urban dynamics, where I integrate machine learning with cyberGIS to predict and analyze complex urban phenomena (e.g. Urban Heat Islands) and develop frameworks for extracting information from heterogenous spatiotemporal data (e.g. high-frequency sensor data, social media data); 2) scalable spatial algorithms for solving complex geospatial problems, including developing scalable algorithms and models for geospatial analysis (e.g. remote sensing image fusion) using high-performance computing; and 3) democratization of data-intensive geographic research, where I innovate geospatial middleware approaches to simplify access to advanced cyberinfrastructure and enable collaborative geographic research and education.

I am looking for a PhD student to join in Fall 2026 (fully funded by Research Assistantship) & multiple master's students in Spring & Fall 2026 (fully funded by Teaching Assistantship). Please contact me at fangzheng@vt.edu if you are interested.
